This project has two programs:
  * wav-svg command line utility
  * DrawSound GUI tool

Both of them allow you to convert a WAV file into SVG and an SVG file into a WAV file.

The generated SVG file has one polyline element for each audio channel.

SVG audio format
-------

The SVG format representing an audio signal must be defined to have the same reference between the two ways of transformation. The SVG must 
contains a list of <polyline> elements. Each polyline is one audio channel.

```xml
<svg>
	<polyline points="..." />
	<polyline points="..." />
</svg>
```

A polyline element is a series of points linked togather with a line. Please refer to any SVG tutorial or documentation to learn more on this SVG element.

The SVG coordinate system varies according to the number of channel. The X-axis is always 1000 size. One channel uses a Y-axis of 500.

The WAV samples are always between [-1.0 +1.0] (min and max of a sinus) and are normalized between [0 500] during the transformation, for the first channel. 
All other channels are located under the previous one with a 500 Y-axis offset. There is theorically no limitations on the number of channels.

Acknowledgements
-------

Thanks to the Pyhon library wav2vec https://github.com/cristoper/wav2vec, my SVG file format is the same.
